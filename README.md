Project Description  

For my Senior Project I decided to create an Mobile App using Xamarin on Visual Studios 2015.  
The premise of my app is that it will allows users the ability to anonymously nominate and vote for food locations to go to with their friends.  
There will be three steps to the core app process:  
1st) A user starts a group either with friends from the users contacts or by adding names in the case of running the app offline and with friends around the user.  
2nd) Once all your friends are in the group, start planning the nomination and voting process by selecting the time limits for the respective user actions. The time limits are used as an upper bound on nominating and voting so that one inattentive user doesn't hold up the entire process, as well as allowing for the ability to plan a food excursion in less than 30 minutes.  
3rd) After the time limits are set, nomination begins. Each user has the ability to anonmyously nominate one food location. Once all the nominations are in, or the time limit has been reached, the voting process begins.  
4th) When the voting process begins, a list of all food nominations appears with a checkbox to the left of it. Each user has 1 vote to select food place of their choice. Once all votes are in, or the time limit has been reached, either the winner is chosen by having the most votes or the runoff voting process begins.  
5th) In the case of a tie for first, the runoff voting process occurs. The nominations that are tied for first are the options to choose from in the runoff vote, and each user has 1 vote again. Once all votes are in, or the time limit has been reached, either the winner is chosen by having the most votes, or another tie is reached.  
6th) In the case of another tie after the runoff voting process has completed, a winner will be randomly chosen from the nominations that were tied for most votes.  
7th) After a winner is chosen, the winning nomination will be displayed to all users, and the option to start planning will be available to the user once more.  

Installation Instructions  
For development purposes, app will be available for sideloading once there is substantial work done.
